title: 'Rory Sutherland: Life lessons from an ad man'
description: >-
  Advertising adds value to a product by changing our perception, rather than
  the product itself. Rory Sutherland makes the daring assertion that a change
  in perceived value can be just as satisfying as what we consider "real" value
  -- and his conclusion has interesting consequences for how we look at life.
